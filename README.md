# ATM Simulator

A simple ATM Simulator implemented in Python to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, encapsulation, methods, and basic user interaction via the command line.

This project is suitable for beginners who are learning Python and OOP fundamentals.


## 📌 Features

- Create an ATM user with a name

- Set and verify a secure PIN

- Check account balance

- Deposit money

- Withdraw money with balance validation

- Block card after multiple incorrect PIN attempts

- Demonstrates encapsulation and name mangling in Python
## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Classes and Objects

- Constructors 

- Private variables (__variable)

- Methods

- Conditional statements

- User input handling

- Name Mangling in Python
## ▶️ How to Run

- Run in Jupyter Notebook

1) Open Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab

2) Load the file:

   ATM Simulator.ipynb

3) Run the cells step by step
## ⚠️ Notes

- PIN is mandatory for transactions

- Card is blocked after multiple incorrect PIN attempts

- This is a console-based simulation, not connected to any real banking system
## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add transaction history

- Use file/database storage for persistence

- Add GUI (Tkinter / Web Interface)

- Improve input validation
